# Design Decisions

The following design decisions were made during the development of Pi-Sentinel:

* **Using Rust as the programming language**: Due to its memory safety features, performance, and growing ecosystem.
* **Choosing a modular architecture**: To allow for easy maintenance, testing, and extension of individual components.
* **Integrating with external APIs for price data**: To provide real-time and accurate cryptocurrency price data.
* **Using a message queue for component communication**: To enable loose coupling and scalability between components.

These design decisions were made to ensure the system's reliability, performance, and maintainability.
