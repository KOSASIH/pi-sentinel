Standing watch over the Pi Network, PiSentinel is a consensus algorithm that safeguards security, decentralization, and scalability.

# Introduction

PiSentinel is a cutting-edge consensus algorithm designed to safeguard the security, decentralization, and scalability of the Pi Network. As a decentralized, community-driven project, PiSentinel ensures that the Pi Network remains a robust and reliable platform for users worldwide.

# What is PiSentinel?

PiSentinel is a novel consensus algorithm that combines the benefits of traditional proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) systems. By leveraging a hybrid approach, PiSentinel achieves a unique balance between security, decentralization, and scalability, making it an ideal solution for the Pi Network.

# Key Features

## Security

- Immutable Ledger: PiSentinel ensures the integrity of the Pi Network's ledger, preventing any unauthorized modifications or attacks.
- Advanced Cryptography: PiSentinel employs state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and protect user data.

## Decentralization

- Distributed Consensus: PiSentinel enables a decentralized network of nodes to reach consensus, ensuring that no single entity controls the network.
- Community-Driven: PiSentinel is an open-source project, allowing the community to contribute to its development and decision-making process.

## Scalability

- High Transaction Throughput: PiSentinel's hybrid consensus algorithm enables fast transaction processing, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
- Low Latency: PiSentinel's optimized architecture ensures rapid transaction confirmation, providing a seamless user
experience.

## Technical Overview

PiSentinel consists of two primary components:

- Runtime: The runtime environment responsible for executing tasks related to cryptography and mathematics.
- Substrate: The underlying substrate that manages the task queue, storage, and communication between nodes.
